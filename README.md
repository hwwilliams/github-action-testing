# Github Workflow Failure Dispatch

This repo is for testing the creation of a GitHub issue for failed workflows. The GitHub issue will contain context about the workflow and the error message from the workflow logs.

The issues are created in a separate repo at https://github.com/hwwilliams/github-workflow-failure-issue-creation
